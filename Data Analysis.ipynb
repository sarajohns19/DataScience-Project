    "### Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Education is an important pillar in our society today. Many parents in America feel dissatisfied with the public school system. The goal of this project is to identify some factors which may contribute parent perceptions of their child's school. We will be using New York City as a model, as it has over 400 high schools and has made data from their annual school survey available for analysis. This survey collects responses to a number of questions pertaining to many aspects of education, but we are focusing on trust & family ties, safety, and personal attention & support as indicators of overall parent perception. We will investigate if parent perception of these aspects differ as a function of the school's location or educational opportunities such as AP courses or Career Training courses. By generating this predictive model, we can determine how to improve parent perceptions of schools in the future."

The Percent of Students Who Feel Safe seems to be more correlated to Parent RR than Graduation Rate or Attendance Rate. Also, interestingly, whether CTE programs are offered seems to be inversely related to Parent RR when grouped by Neighborhoods. Looking only at boroughs, Statten Island (SI) stands out more from the other buroughs. While there does not seem to be a strong trend between Percent Satisfaction and borough, there does seem to be a strong trend between School Statistics and borough, suggesting that parents are more concerned with more nuanced measures of school environment rather than the liklihood of their student to graduate or attend class, or the types of programs offered at the school.

    "Next, using our findings from our exploratory data analysis, we will move into the data analysis phase of our project. This phase includes the following objectives:\n",

    "For Objective 1:\n",
    "We will use multilinear regression to determine if there is any significant relationship between the three educational elements, i.e. if the answers to the questions pertaining to each element are correlated to one another. We will also use multilinear regression to determine if there is any significant relationship between the parents' perception of these elements and the opportunities available at the schools, i.e. if the answers to the questions pertaining to each element are correlated to the number of extracurricular activites, AP classes, and career training programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Objective 2:\n",
    "Using the multilinear regression models from Objective 1, we might be able to determine if safety perception is a confounder for parent trust in the school, involvement, and response rate.     \n",
    "\n",
    "For Objective 3: \n",
    "After performing multilinear regression, we will take the most significant variables and use the to build a model using a decision tree and support vector machines to predict positive parent response rates. To determine if there is a dependence of parent response on school location, we will add school boroughs and districts to determine which, if either, improves the predictive model."
