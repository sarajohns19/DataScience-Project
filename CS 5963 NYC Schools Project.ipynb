    "### Background and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Education is an important pillar in our society today. Many parents in America feel dissatisfied with the public school system. The goal of this project is to identify the factors that contribute parent perceptions of their child's school. We will be using New York City as a model, as it has over 400 high schools and has made data from their annual school survey available for analysis. This survey collects responses to a number of questions pertaining to many aspects of education, but we are focusing on trust & family ties, safety, and personal attention & support as indicators of overall parent perception. We will investigate if parent perception of these aspects differ as a function of the school's location or educational opportunities. By generating this predictive model, we can determine how to improve parent perceptions of schools in the future."

    "    - How do these elements relate to each other?\n",
    "    - How do these elements relate to the opportunities available at these schools (extracurriculars, AP classes, CTE)? \n",

    "**Objective 3.** What are the factors that could potentially improve parent perceptions of our education system? \n",
